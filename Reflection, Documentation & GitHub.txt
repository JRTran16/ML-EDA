Questions for Students
• What were the most surprising insights from this dataset?

From this dataset, the lack of data collected from rural areas makes difficult to understand the overall situation of GenZ dating in India.
Another concern would be the limited number of categories in gender columns.

• What would you do differently if given more time?

If given more time, I would try to explore more and understand how transforming categorical values into numerical values work, due to the lack of time, I had to rush that aspect and I was also getting multiple errors that I need to avoid next time I use One Hot encoding.


• How can we improve dataset documentation for others?

For others, we can use a README file to allow others understand what the dataset is about and how missing values are handled and what have we uncover so far from it.
