Final Challenge

1. If a dating app wanted to expand into rural India, which insights from this dataset
would be most valuable?

From this dataset, the insights that are going to be valuable are the Age and Gender trends, younger users (18-22) are more active so they can target people of this group in rural areas.
Another insights would be which apps are more popular and what features people prefer.

2. If you were designing a new dating app based on this data, what two features would
you add?

If I had to create a new dating app, I would add security features such as 2step verification.

3. What were the biggest data cleaning challenges in this dataset?

The biggest cleaning challenge came from the 'Daily_Usage_Time', we had to convert them into numerical values, since I was using different jupyter notebooks, I had to do it everytime.
